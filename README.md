# Art Gallery (Group 10)
## Main Scope of the Project
In this project, a gallery software system will be developed that allows artists to connect to customers, showcase and sell their artwork. The software development team will gather requirements, design a multi-tier software solution to satisfy those requirements, implement the system, validate that the system is satisfying the requirements, and develop a release pipeline to automate the software delivery process. 
All functionality of the system will be made accessible via web frontend and an Android system shall allow execution of most important functionality for the different stakeholders.
